# Boston_Tree_Finder
<p>Hello! This is the final project I made in EK125 - Introduction to Programming for Engineers Fall 2018</p>

<p>
  It's a MATLAB program that draws data from a database with information on trees in Boston. It draws a map of all the trees and uses the Google Location API
  to provide data on distance, travel times, and more. 
</p>
<p>
  It also features two C programs that are executed to find minimum lengths and distances from the data.
